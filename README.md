Recommender system
===

## For developers
The `core` package contains domain independent classes and interfaces for the recommender system. Implement these interfaces in classes for the specific domain in the root (or another) package.

The class `core/RecommenderSystem` is the main interface for the recommender system functionality. `Main` is supposed to run a command line interface using an instance of `core/RecommenderSystsem`.
